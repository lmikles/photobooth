photobooth
==========

Photobooth python code for Raspberry Pi. 
This code takes pics, puts a watermark on them, creates an animated gif, uploads it to tumblr, and uploads the individual pics to a dropbox account. I use those photos to run a screesaver during a party called photolive (http://www.partytools.net/photolive/index_e.php#.VHYupJOS2Dt) that continually puls fresh photos from the folder.

This code is the assembly of many others who actually know what they are doing. I cobbled the pieces together from a number of gracious and highly intelligent peeps, including:
Raspi.TV - Dropping tons of dropbox knowledge - http://raspi.tv/2013/raspicamcorder-2-standalone-raspberry-pi-camcorder-with-buttons-screen-and-dropbox-capability
Drumminghands - For creating a solid base of photobooth code and the wiring. I basically started here.

I'd love any feedback on cleaning up the code. All I know is that it works, and it was a hit at the party.
